**CRISP** = Calibration and Research Imaging System for Plastic scintillator

CRISP, the master's project of Robin de Freitas and Lewis Dean, is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for proton beam monitoring. It facilitates scintillation light imaging, which is generated during proton beam interactions within a plastic scintillator, using a series of Raspberry Pi cameras. CRISP allows for the calibration of these cameras, the optimal imaging of scintillation light, and the analysis of light distributions to calculate Bragg peak depths within the scintillator.
